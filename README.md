# Kaggle Competitions Repository

This repository contains my projects from various Kaggle competitions. Each project demonstrates my approach to solving real-world problems using machine learning and data science techniques.

## üìÇ Current Projects
### 1. **Tiny ImageNet Classification (CSE144 Final Project)**
- **Dataset**: Tiny ImageNet
- **Objective**: Classify images accurately using machine learning models.
- **Highlights**:
  - Built a neural network from scratch but switched to pre-trained models for higher accuracy.
  - Achieved:
    - ResNet: **46%**
    - ResNet101: **70%**
    - ResNet152: **72%**
- **Achievement**: Ranked **7th out of 180** in [CSE144 Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ucsc-cse-144-spring-2022-final-project/leaderboard).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup for Future Projects
This repository will include:
- New Kaggle competition projects.
- Documentation for datasets, models, and approaches.
- Continuous improvement and exploration of machine learning techniques.

Stay tuned for updates!
