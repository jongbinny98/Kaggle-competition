This project I used the tiny_imageNet dataset that was given by CSE144(Applied Machine Learning) at UCSC. And I used this dataset to correctly classify the image.
I started building the neural network from scratch. However, I was not able to get high accuracy, so I decided to use pre_build model to achieve high accuracy.
I finally got enough accuracy as seen below.

----> ResNet: 46% accuracy

----> ResNet101: 70% accuracy

----> ResNet152: 72% accuracy
